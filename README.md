Using or giving a dormitory service in a University has become an oppressive issue; First, Students face many problems in the services that the dormitory has to provide. Problems like electrical problems (outlet failure or light problem), furniture problems (door locks, window or bed), and even sometimes, reporting lost Items or the misconduct of dorm mates is not that easy. Secondly, the proctors will run to lots of hardships when addressing these great number of issues for large numbers of students. But, with the help of this website, Student Dormitory Assistant, now students can make a reservation and they can wait for their complaints and reports to be addressed with out waiting in line for hours or even days at times and the proctors will have an easier time addressing problems.
